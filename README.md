# Microsoft-engage-2022
My Microsoft engage 2022 project. I have made project on data analysis challenge.


1] microsoft_project.ipynb is my main project in which I have done analysis in google colab. For running you will need to download car_engage_2022.csv first.

2] LR_price_model is my price prediction model. For running it you will need to download clean_set csv file.

3] clean_car_set.csv is my cleaned data csv file.

4] Webapp.py is my streamlit web app.

5] Predict_page is the streamlit web page used for price prediction.

6] customer_segmentation page is the streamlit page used for plotting customer segmentation graph.

7] explore_page is the page in streamlit which contains the data exploriation part.


# Car Data Analysis
I have done the detailed data analysis of car dataset. I have done Customer segmentation. I have solved problems of Legal and Illegal cars. I have made bar charts, Pie charts, heat map, mix graph. Also, I have made price prediction model using Linear Regression.

# Technicalities used
I have used Python and it's libraries, Machine Learning and for making web interface and deployment I have used Streamlit.

#Running streamlit app on terminal

streamlit run app.py

# Features
I have segmented the customers on the basis of income using the price factor. I have segmented legal and illegal cars on the basis of emission norm. I have found that companies must focus on making which type of body in cars using bar plot.
